======

This mod doesn't add much in the current modjam release. However, it does world gen drone core spires that will spawn Defence drones, creeping blocks(metal grass), and a boss after a short while.

Features
-Custom schematics for drone spire world gen
-copy and past tools to create schematics
-Defence Drone II
-Boss Gigus aka core guardian
-Creeping metal that as a 10% chance to drop iron


How to use
1) Creative mode
The spire and drops can be spawned threw creative mode items. These items are located in the tools tab. 

2) World Gen
The spires are generated in new worlds at a 6% chance and at least 200 blocks from another spire
After 20 kills of drones the drone spawn rate will double
After 50 the boss will start to spawn
Destroying the core will stop spawns, traps, and defeat the spire
The boss will drop 0-100 iron bars on death

Creating custom schematics
Threw the resource pack it may be possilbe though not fully tested to load in custom spire schematics. At this time only SpireTwo.dat can be overrided as its the only one to load. The schematic must have the core 18 blocks bellow the ground level or it will gen incorrectly.

Schematics are saved to minecraft folder in a file called Schamatics. The schematic will save with the name of the player and time of creation. 

When the world edit pencil tool saves a schematic it will use the following to set parm into the schematic and will not save the actual blockID of the following.
Gold Ore -> Path A
Lapiz Ore -> Path B
Gold BLock -> Spawn Trap
Diamond Block - > Fall Trap
Coal ore - > schematic tool spawn point for player
SandStone -> ignores the block space allowing for dirt,stone,etc to stay after gen
